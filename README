asyncio event loop scheduling callbacks in eventlet.

* Trollius project: http://trollius.readthedocs.org/
* aiogreen at PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/aiogreen


Installation
============

Requirements:

- eventlet 0.14 or newer
- asyncio or trollius:

  * Python 3.4 and newer: asyncio is now part of the stdlib
  * Python 3.3: need Tulip 0.4.1 or newer (pip install asyncio)
  * Python 2.6-3.2: need trollius 1.0 or newer (pip install trollius)

Type::

    pip install aiogreen

or::

    python setup.py install


Run tests
=========

Run tests with tox
------------------

The `tox project <https://testrun.org/tox/latest/>`_ can be used to build a
virtual environment with all runtime and test dependencies and run tests
against different Python versions (2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3).

For example, to run tests with Python 2.7, just type::

    tox -e py27

To run tests against other Python versions:

* ``py26``: Python 2.6
* ``py27``: Python 2.7
* ``py27_patch``: Python 2.7 with eventlet monkey patching
* ``py32``: Python 3.2
* ``py33``: Python 3.3
* ``py34``: Python 3.4

Run tests manually
------------------

Run the following command from the directory of the aiogreen project:

    python runtests.py -r


Changelog
=========

Version 0.2 (development version)
---------------------------------

* Support also eventlet 0.14, not only eventlet 0.15 or newer
* Support eventlet with monkey-patching
* Rewrite the code handling file descriptors to ensure that the listener is
  only called once per loop iteration, to respect asyncio specification.
* Simplify the loop iteration: remove custom code to reuse instead the
  asyncio/trollius code (_run_once)
* Reuse call_soon, call_soon_threadsafe, call_at, call_later from
  asyncio/trollius, remove custom code
* sock_connect() is now asynchronous
* Add a suite of automated unit tests
* Fix EventLoop.stop(): don't stop immediatly, but schedule stopping the event
  loop with call_soon()
* Add tox.ini to run tests with tox

2014-11-19: version 0.1
-----------------------

* First public release


Implemented
===========

Methods:

* call_at()
* call_later()
* call_soon()
* run_forever()
* run_in_executor()
* run_until_complete()
* create_connection(): TCP client
* stop()
* coroutines and tasks

Tests of aiogreen 0.1:

* Tested on Python 2.7, 3.3 and 3.5
* Tested on Linux and Windows
* Tested with Trollius 1.0, 1.0.1 and 1.0.2
* Tested with asyncio 0.4.1 and 3.4.2


To do (Not supported)
=====================

* run an event loop in a thread different than the main thread
* sockets: create_server, sock_recv
* pipes: connect_read_pipe
* subprocesses: need pipes
* signal handlers: add_signal_handler (only for pyevent hub?)
* tox.ini: add py33_patch. eventlet with Python 3 and monkey-patch causes
  an issue in importlib.
