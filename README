Changelog
=========

Version 0.2 (development version)
---------------------------------

* Support also eventlet 0.14, not only eventlet 0.15 or newer
* Support eventlet with monkey-patching
* Rewrite the code handling file descriptors to ensure that the listener is
  only called once per loop iteration, to respect asyncio specification.
* sock_connect() is now asynchronous
* Add a suite of automated unit tests
* Fix EventLoop.stop(): don't stop immediatly, but schedule stopping the event
  loop with call_soon()
