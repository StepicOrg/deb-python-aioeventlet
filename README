aiogreen implements the asyncio API (PEP 3156) on top of eventlet. It makes
possible to write asyncio code in a project currently written for eventlet.

aiogreen allows to use greenthreads in asyncio coroutines, and to use asyncio
coroutines, tasks and futures in greenthreads: see ``link_future()`` and
``wrap_greenthread()`` functions.

The main visible difference between aiogreen and trollius is the behaviour of
``run_forever()``: ``run_forever()`` blocks with trollius, whereas it runs in a
greenthread with aiogreen. It means that aiogreen event loop can run in an
greenthread while the Python main thread runs other greenthreads in parallel.
